* `sim_observational_cad_tte_mace.R`: script to simulate an
  hypothetical observational clinical study that aims at comparing
  two treatments for the treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD)
  patients. The time-to-first MACE is the endpoint of interest. Four
  scenarios are simulated. Overall, 1000 datasets are simulated for 
  all scenarios. Moreover, a sample dataset to be used as reference has
  been selected for all scenarios. The following four scenarios are
  considered:
  
  1. Homogeneous treatment effect and independent censoring
  2. Heterogeneous treatment effect and independent censoring
  3. Homogeneous treatment effect and covariate-dependent censoring
  4. Heterogeneous treatment effect and covariate-dependent censoring
